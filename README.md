# VERTEX70
This repository is to manage code for processing data collected using the Bruker VERTEX 70 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer. This code was generated through activities at the Department of Geography at King's College London using the National Centre of Earth Observaton's spectrometer.

Further details about this instrument and setup are available in [Langsdale et al. (2021)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/1/102).

The code presented in this repository makes use of the [brukeropusreader](https://github.com/qedsoftware/brukeropusreader) package to process the raw OPUS files to emissivity.
