# Processing the VERTEX 70 Data
This repository is to manage code for processing data collected using the National Centre of Earth Observaton's Bruker VERTEX 70 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer based at the Department of Geography at King's College London. Further details about this instrument and setup are available in [Langsdale et al. (2021)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/1/102). The code presented in this repository makes use of the [brukeropusreader](https://github.com/qedsoftware/brukeropusreader) package to process the raw OPUS files to emissivity.

Additional code is available for reading in and plotting data from the ECOSTRESS spectral library.
